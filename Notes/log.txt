# Clothing Store POS System (JavaFX Standalone)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a standalone Point of Sale (POS) system designed for a retail clothing store. 
It is developed as part of the **iCET (Institute of Computer Engineering Technology)** coursework. 
The application is built using **Java** and **JavaFX** for the frontend, with **MySQL** as the database backend.

## 🚀 Current Progress: Phase 1 - Database Design
The initial phase focuses on designing a robust Relational Database Schema to handle complex retail operations.

### 🗂 Database Schema Highlights (ER Diagram)
The system is architected to handle specific clothing retail needs, including:

* **Product Variants:** Implemented a `Variant` entity to separate base products (e.g., "T-Shirt") from specific stock keeping units (Size/Color combinations).
* **Inventory Management:** Includes `re_order_lvl` (Re-order Level) alerts and multi-location tracking.
* **User & Employee Separation:** Distinct entities for `Users` (System Access) and `Employees` (HR/Payroll data) to enhance security.
* **Supplier Relations:** Tracks lead times and supplier-specific product catalogs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (JDK 17)
* **UI Framework:** JavaFX
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Architecture:** Layered Architecture

SQL Filtering Efficiency:
    ◦ Avoid Functions in Filters: Do not apply functions to columns in a WHERE clause (e.g., WHERE YEAR(date) = 2023). This prevents the database from using an index. Instead, use a range (e.g., WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31').
    ◦ Wildcards: Avoid leading wildcards in text searches (e.g., LIKE '%value') as they prevent index usage. Trailing wildcards (LIKE 'value%') are acceptable.
    ◦ Operators: Use IN instead of multiple OR conditions, as OR can kill performance.
    • Set Operators: Use UNION ALL instead of UNION whenever possible. UNION performs an expensive check for duplicates, whereas UNION ALL simply stacks results, which is much faster.
    • Data Removal: Use TRUNCATE instead of DELETE when clearing a table. TRUNCATE is faster because it skips the extensive logging and row-by-row deletion protocols required by DELETE.

     Docker  Basics
//////////////////////////
Core Concepts:
Docker Image: A read-only blueprint or template with instructions for creating a container. It contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and settings needed to run the application.
Docker Container: A runnable instance of an image. It is a lightweight, isolated environment where the application actually runs. Multiple containers can run on the same machine without interfering with each other.
Dockerfile: A simple text file that contains all the commands needed to build a Docker image automatically.
Docker Hub/Registry: A central repository for storing and sharing Docker images. We can use pre-built official images (e.g., for databases or web servers) or push our own custom images. 

# Use a specific OpenJDK version as the base image
FROM openjdk:17

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Java source file into the container
COPY HelloWorld.java .

# Compile the Java program
RUN javac HelloWorld.java

# Set the default command to run the compiled Java program
CMD ["java", "HelloWorld"]
